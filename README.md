## Overview of the statistical analysis:
Our client is planning to open a surf and ice cream shop on the island of Oahu and wants to figure out which locations are the most promising. Using weather data from June to December, we will be able to make an informed decision based on weather trends around the island. If we can get a successful location opened and running, we can use this same approach to expand to other islands.

## Results:
The statistical summary of temperatures for 1700 locations for the month of June is shown below.
- mean: 74.9
- std:  3.3
- min:  64
- 25%:  73
- 50%:  75
- 75%:  77
- max:  85

Looking at 1,517 locations for the month of December we found the following.
- mean: 71
- std:  3.75
- 25%:  69
- 50%:  71
- 75%:  74
- max:  83

The maximum temperatures only vary by two degrees from 85 in June and 83 in December. The average temps showed slightly more of a difference at 75 and 71 degrees. We do see more of a marked difference in minimum temperatures going from 64 in June to 56 in December. 56 is pretty cool for ice cream and/or surfing so we can anticipate business being slow in December and it may not be worth staying open through the month.

## Summary:

The weather statistics are surprisingly similar for June and December. However, the minimum temperatures reflected an 8 degree swing. 8 degrees may not sound like a huge deal but considering our goal (to sell ice cream and tempt potential surfers), it's certainly an important consideration. It could be benificial to look at ocean temperature data as well. We could also break down the data to look at values during the hours of operation. Temperatures in the overnight hours when the shop is closed shouldn't weigh into any big decisions. All things considered, we can use this approach to decide where to expand the business with new locations throughout the islands.
